Predicting Life Expectancy using Machine Learning

This project builds a regression model based on data provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) to evaluate the life expectancy for different countries in years. The data offers a time frame from 2000 to 2015.

This project focus on certain factors like regional variation, economic factors, education, expenditure on healthcare system and some specific disease related deaths that happened in the country, GDP, population.
